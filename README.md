# Deep-learning-based-driver-drowsiness-detection
The system designed achieves the objective of detecting drowsy driver and notifies the driver with alarming signal and appropriate audio message. With the help of CNN algorithm and Haar cascade files faster detection of face and extraction of facial features according to which the model predicts the mental state of the driver through which his behavioral features, include eye blinking, yawning and head tilt detection. With the help of deep learning technology even if the size is small, we get high accuracy, with the algorithm in place, the accuracy of 96% is achieved. As system is compact, and can be easily integrated in modern cars as it just requires camera and raspberry pi module. In case of consecutive violation of drowsiness threshold an email is sent to the concerned person with a message and current location of the driver is shared to that person. The systems accuracy gets little compromised in highly dark conditions.
